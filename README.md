# Bookstore API

A small demo project written with the **.Net Core 3.1 Web API** template.  All models were scaffolded by **Entity Framework** via a "database first" approach. The project structure is derived from [Les Jackson's The Complete ASP.NET CORE 3 API Tutorial ](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-ASP-NET-Core-Tutorial-Hands/dp/1484262549)


## Important Dependencies

 1. **Entity Framework** - Mediator between the database and controllers.
 2. **Swashbuckle/Swagger** - API documentation
 3. **FluentValidation** - Validation tool for data transfer objects
